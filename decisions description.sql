
1. Hawkeye technology helps supports umpires in their decison making on court. At times, when umpires are not sure whether balls
played are just in or out, they call on haweye, a real-time technology which has video data on ball movements on court. 
Find courts which have hawkeye technology and their condition or courts without hawkeye. 
It would be also beneficial to determine the installation and replacement costs of hawkeye technology on court to help 
management know how much money to spend on it, as this would improve the quality of games.

2.Surveillance and giant screens have the ability to improve the quality of competitions and for good decision making. Surveillance can help to
detect unfortunate incidences that may have occurred in the stadia and to identify perpetrators that may have been involved in the acts.  
Giant screens help spectators re-live certain good moments during the game such as a great point won by the players. Find any giant screens 
or surveillance equipment absent or present in the stadia and their conditions so as to know their states and whether they need installation or replacement and how much it will cost, so as to know how much to set aside for it.
Include technolgy condition of courts as they are found in stadia, so that decision makers can make the budget at the stadia level.

3. We want to make a decision to find how much to spend out of the budget to install or replace all technology devices in the entire complex(in the courts and stadia). As well as how much to spend to install surveillance at the four 
corners of the complex for human safety, as this would improve quality of games at the complex and also security at the complex.

4. For games played in the evening or late afternoon, lighting is key. This is also related to the theme human comfort and safety.
From the latest_parameters view, the min floodlight value for comfort is 30000 lumens, while the max light value for comfort is 60000 lumens.
Find the stadia which has floodlights values of 30000 lumens or greater, so a decision can be made about more games being scheduled to be played
at the stadia with great lighting. [Associated with H8 in the pyramid]


5. A decision has to be made on whether ticket prices should go up or remain the 
same. Assuming the budget for maintenance costs and fixing assets in the complex
 is 30,000 pounds, if for a three-day grand slam tournament, all three
 stadia are filled to capacity, how much will be obtained at the end of the 
tournament? Having spent 30,000 pounds on maintenance in preparation for the 
event, will the complex run at a loss or make profit? After running the query if
 a loss is estimated, the ticket prices should be increased. If a profit is 
estimated, ticket prices should remain the same.

6. Find the total cost to replace players benches, umpire chairs and nets in bad condition which will be used to decide what percentage of the total budget to be spent in preparation of tournaments and also for the comfort of players and umpire, which eventually lead to the improvement of tournaments  [Associated with H6 in the pyramid]


7. Find the total cost to replace floodlights in bad condition, which will be used to decide what percentage of the total budget to be spent on floodlights replacement.
